# SARndbox configuration and code
I do not own any of the resources found here, including DEMs, source code, heightmaps, scripts, etc. I have just been using them for my own AR Sandbox configuration, which was also used in a usability study in the journal paper:
```
Moore, Antoni, et al. "Comparative usability of an augmented reality sandtable and 3D GIS for education." 
International Journal of Geographical Information Science 34.2 (2020): 229-250.
```

### SARndbox
The basis of this software is originally developed by Oliver Kreylos, UC Davis. Minor changes were made to acommodate additional functionality for a usability study, but all credit goes to the original author. The original licenses are provided within each sub-directory. Please see the following resources for more information:

### Digital elevation models
Data provided in the DEM sub-directory provided was originally accessed from [LINZ](https://data.linz.govt.nz/layer/51768-nz-8m-digital-elevation-model-2012/) which was provided under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode), and re-formatted for readability by our Sandbox software.
