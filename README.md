# Sandbox configuration and code

I do not own any of the resources found here, including DEMs, source code, heightmaps, scripts, etc. I have just been using them for my own AR Sandbox configuration. Use at your own risk.

This code is originally written by Oliver Kreylos, UC Davis. I have made some small changes to acommodate the some additional functionality, but all credit goes to the original author.
